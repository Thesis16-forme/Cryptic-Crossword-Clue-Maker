              The Cryptic Clue Constructor is a creative tool designed for crossword enthusiasts, aspiring setters, and anyone intrigued by the art of cryptic clues. It leverages the power of generative AI to help you craft unique and stylish clues for any answer you can think of.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300">How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Simply provide an answer, a straightforward definition for that answer, and select from a range of classic cryptic clue types (like anagrams, charades, and hidden words). The app's core feature is its ability to emulate the distinct styles of legendary crossword setters. By choosing a setter like 'Paul', 'Araucaria', or 'Ximenes', you can guide the AI to generate a clue that captures their signature wit, difficulty, and linguistic flair.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This application is powered by Google's Gemini model. The AI has been trained to understand the intricate rules and conventions of cryptic crosswords. When you provide your inputs and select a setter, it adopts that persona to create a clue that is not only technically correct but also stylistically appropriate.

            <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              This is a tool for entertainment and creative exploration. While the AI is highly capable, the generated clues may occasionally be imperfect. Always review and refine the output to best suit your needs.
